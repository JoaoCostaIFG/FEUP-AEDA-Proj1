### Know bugs
The code on this repository was left *as is* on the dead-line for delivery so the bugs listed below should be fixed on the second part of the project:  
- Reading list of users' (CCs) who have bought an event from files (missing a vector clear)  
- Information validity checking when using some of the setters (information changing)  
- Can't remember the others (if any)..
