# FEUP-AEDA-Proj1
First project for the AEDA chair (FEUP MIEIC 2019/2020).  
Chosen project theme: **Cart√£o Museus de Portugal**.  

### NOTES
Google tests and doxygen have been commented out from the CMakeLists file.
You can uncomment them at your discretion if you want to use them.  
If you uncomment the google tests lib from the CMakeLists file, you still
need to uncomment the include line in the **main.cpp** file.  

### UML
Our [UML file](UML_class_diagram.svg) was drawn using [draw.io](https://www.draw.io).  
Our UML is provided in the **[UML_class_diagram.svg](UML_class_diagram.svg)** file as an SVG.

- Reading list of users' (CCs) who have bought an event from files (missing a vector clear)  
- Information validity checking when using some of the setters (information changing)  
- Can't remember the others (if any)..
